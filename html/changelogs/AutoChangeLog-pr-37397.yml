- rscadd: 'A new engine has been added: fission reactors! Used in conjunction with
    a TEG, they can make a respectable amount of power with a low upkeep.'
- rscadd: Fission reactors can either be ordered from a cargo crate, or unlocked with
    the help of the science department and miners.
- rscadd: Fueling a fission reactor will require some outside assistance. Ask a miner
    for some uranium, or the chemist for some radium.
- rscadd: Fission reactors can convert certain non-fuel reagents into them to more
    exotic ones.
- rscadd: 'Fission reactors will produce a new gas as a byproduct: Radon. Radon is
    highly radioactive, and can supercharge the supermatter (caution is advised)'
