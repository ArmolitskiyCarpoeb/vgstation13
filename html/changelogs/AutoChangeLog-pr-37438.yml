changes:
- spellcheck: Fixes several typos and improper capitalization on a bunch of fission
    reactor stuff.
- spellcheck: Renames the Fuel Rod (object) to Fuel Reservoir, to reduce the confusion
    between the machinery fuel rod and the object, since no matter how many fuel rod
    cores you have in your reactor, you only ever need 1 (one) fuel rod (now reservoir).
